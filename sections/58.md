## [58 - Why the designer and the implementor of a program should be the same person](http://webofstories.com/play/17117)

Getting the first version of TeX to work, I also had to get the fonts
ready, the letter forms, and after, after five months I had something
I could finally test, and I, but after, after two days I realized why
my students hadn't gotten any further than they did, because I had to
keep changing the language constantly, every, several times an hour as
I was beginning to write the code, and if the students, several of my
friends have tried to, to direct software projects where they set the
specifications and they say to the students, write the code, and it
never works, and now I know why, because the students would have to
schedule an appointment. Every few minutes they have the students
working on it, they have to schedule an appointment with the professor
to, to discuss what the issue is, and then the professor would have
to, you know, take 15 minutes to get in the frame of mind to
understand what the problem is, or he'll say, oh yes, do this, and
then the student can go back and work for another five minutes before
another question comes up. So it just takes forever. When you do
enough, working on a first generation software like this I think it
has to be done, the designer and the implementer have to be the same
person.)
