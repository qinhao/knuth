## [13 - Meeting my wife Jill](http://webofstories.com/play/17072)

At my fraternity, my best friend, who was also in the Honor Section at
Case, his name is Bill Davis, he now, by the way, is a mathematics
professor at Ohio State, and is very active in internet online
education for teaching mathematics, but anyway, **Bill and I were bosom
buddies during my freshman year**, and he, and then also in the
sophomore year we both pledged Theta Chi fraternity, and so then we
also went through Hell Week together and had rooms next to each other
in the fraternity house.

So **I started to date a girl** at Western
Reserve University; her name was Betsy, and her roommate was named
Jill, and **Bill was dating Jill**, so I was — now, Betsy was Catholic, and
I was Lutheran, and this was something that we thought, well, our
families would never be able to understand, but still I thought that
Betsy was pretty terrific, but **I was also dating a girl named Becky**, a
Jewish girl, whose father owned a department store in Cleveland and **I
was dating some nurses too**, you know, there were lots of girls would
hang out around the Case area, and, but I was mostly interested in
this Betsy, and I was, I decided to, and we’d had double dates with
Bill Davis and his girl Jill, and as I said, Betsy and Jill were
roommates; Bill and I were roommates.

So I was wondering, you know,
how I’d ever be able to make more of a hit with Betsy, and I decided I
would have **lunch with Jill, to ask her for advice**. And so this was
probably the, my sophomore year, the spring of my sophomore year, and,
you know, she was such a good listener, and gave such good advice,
that **I started dating Jill instead, and well, I’m not sure Bill ever
forgave me for that**, but she didn’t really like him, she thought, she
said, well, anyway.

Well, anyway, Jill is the one that I eventually
got pinned to, and engaged to and married to, and **we’ve been married
now for 45 years**. And Jill and I started having dates in the library,
where we would study together, and, you know, I found that **I enjoyed
kisses for the first time**, when they came from her. In high school I
was afraid to kiss girls, even when they would stand up.

I mean, I was
dating a girl in high school who was about four and a half feet tall,
I don’t remember her name any more, but I remember that she was real
cute, because, **I always liked short girls**, because they seemed to, you
know, have a good balance, **they didn’t fall over as easily** as tall
ones, and I, being tall, I was, you know, but she was a cheerleader,
and she stood on the steps of her house, and with her lips turned up,
and I figured I’d got to kiss her, but I’d never done this before, how
am I going to do it you know.

And so I did, but **I never realized how
good it could be until I kissed Jill**, when I was a sophomore.
