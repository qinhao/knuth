## [29 - Burroughs Corporation](http://webofstories.com/play/17088)

Burroughs was a company established in the 19th century, and was quite
pre-eminent in the banking industry, **almost everybody used equipment
from Burroughs to do its accounting**, and in the early days of
computing, Burroughs acquired the Electric Data Corporation, in
Pasadena, and they were one of the many companies putting out
computers. And, and as I say, not only that, they had very innovative
computers, and I liked the spirit of all the employees working there
as well.

The — later on, they were acquired by Sperry Rand, this was in
the ’70s, I think, and **became Unisys**, combined with Sperry Rand. So
half of Unisys was from the Burroughs Corporation, and half of it was
the Sperry, which, the Rand, the Remington Rand, the people who had
built the UNIVAC computer. That happened after I was no longer in
Pasadena. And they continued to have banks as their primary customer
base, but then, in more recent years, the, you know, other companies
survived, and there were many, many changes in the computer industry,
to that time.

So Burroughs was, you know, **Edsger Dijkstra was also a
consultant to Burroughs during the 60s**, and he would come out to
Pasadena, visit periodically, and it was a great company to work for
in those days, I think.
