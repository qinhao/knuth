## [3 - My mother](http://webofstories.com/play/17062)

I should say something about my mom, who was also very important in my
life, of course. She was unusual also at that time, because she had a
good job. My **parents were the first** in their families, in the whole
history of our family, **to have some kind of education**. My dad had gone
to a teachers training college in Chicago, and my mother had taken one
or two years of training as a secretary, as a legal secretary.

And in
the, during the Second World War, she got a job working for a man in
downtown Milwaukee, who owned and managed several of the skyscrapers
in town, downtown, and she became his personal secretary, and later a
Trustee of the, of these, of some of the organisations that owned the
property, and the time of his death she was, she had been doing rather
well, and was asked to be, asked to be the manager of one of the
buildings, so **she spent her life working in real estate in Milwaukee**
with the large commercial buildings in the downtown area. And she had
started doing this part time work, when I was five or six years old,
but still doing everything else at home, as well. 

My, but my
grandfather was, my great-grandfather was a blacksmith, my grandfather
was, my grandfathers on both sides, were in construction work, and
maintenance. There was **not a family tradition of education, and I
certainly was the first one ever** to go on to higher levels of
education. Itâ€™s partly the story of America, of course, that more and
more people are going to college, but when I was in high school, at
that time still, it was, I think something like 7% or 8% of my
classmates went on to college, and that was considered pretty good at
that time.)
