## [7 - My sense of humor](http://webofstories.com/play/17066)

Rather than sceptical, cynical, I would prefer satirical or something.
 
KARAGUEUZIAN: Satirical. 
 
KNUTH: But anyway, that’s why I liked *Mad Magazine*, because it was
like crazy type of satire on the sacred cows of the day, and so when
my friends and I discovered in high school, you know, we devoured
every page, and it was a special, you know, **mad about *Mad***. We, and
before that, as I said, I had the corny jokes, but my friends and I
tended to be wise-cracking and not to take things too
seriously.

Although I said I was a machine, but I did also like to
laugh, and so when I was writing for the paper, we always had sections
about jokes, and we always had you know, in our Yearbook we had fun
things in there that weren’t expected. So I’ve carried that through,
as you know, and many; there are **lots of corny jokes in the indexes to
my books** now that people probably haven’t discovered yet, but somebody
will ask me, why do I have a reference to Bo Derek in *The TeXbook*?
And it turns out that just all the pages which are cited in the index
for Bo Derek is where I used the number ten, so all the way through
I’ve had this silly streak of some sort that means I don’t take
everything too seriously.
