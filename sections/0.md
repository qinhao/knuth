## Summary

This is a transcript of an interview with the guy
by Dikran Karagueuzian, the director of CSLI Publications,
videotaped in
2006. Copyright 2006 Web of Stories Ltd., but the version of the
transcript on their web site is just unreadable; this is my effort to
clean it up a bit.
It’s about 63 000 words, so it is probably around three or four 
hours of reading. Printed, it would be about 110 pages.

Patches to improve the formatting and correct errors are
welcome. Please don’t refill the paragraphs, though; it creates
unnecessary merge conflicts.

I know **lots of people are going to hate the random boldface**. But
the interview, like any record of an extempore speech, is not really
organized into headings, subheadings, and the like. The boldface is my
attempt to pull out the main topics of each paragraph so that it’s
possible to skim through the document to find a particular topic.
